# Bids - Auction Web Application

Welcome to **Bids**, an auction web application developed using ASP.NET Core. **Bids** allows users to list items for auction, place bids, and engage in discussions via comments. The highest bidder before the auction closes wins the item.

## Features

- **Listings**: Create and manage auction listings with detailed descriptions and images.
- **Bidding**: Place bids on items of interest. The highest bid wins when the auction closes.
- **Comments**: Engage in discussions by adding comments to any listing.
- **My Listings**: View and manage all of your active and closed listings.
- **My Bids**: Track your bids and monitor auctions where you are the highest bidder.

## How It Works

1. **Create Listings**: Users can create auction listings by providing details such as title, description, starting price, and images.
2. **Place Bids**: Users can place bids on active auctions. The system tracks the highest bid, and the winner is determined once the auction closes.
3. **Add Comments**: Users can discuss items by adding comments to listings.
4. **My Listings**: Users can manage and view their listings, including tracking bid progress and closing auctions.
5. **My Bids**: Users can view all of their bids, including current highest bids and those that have won.
